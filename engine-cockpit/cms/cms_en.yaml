  DemoPortal: Demo Portal
  DemoPortalIntroduction: The demo portal offers the perfect entry point to explore and experience the powerful features of the Axon Ivy platform as a workflow engine. It allows users to discover how easily complex business processes can be automated, streamlined, and optimized. Whether you're looking
    to manage tasks, integrate systems, or orchestrate workflows across departments, the platform provides intuitive tools and a flexible environment to meet your business needs.
  EngineMaintenanceInfo: <p>Therefore the Axon Ivy Engine is currently operating in maintenance mode. If your setup is broken for example because the Axon Ivy Engine can not connect to the system database or the licence has been expired, then go <b><a href="setup.xhtml">Setup Wizard</a></b> to fix it.
    If the Axon Ivy Engine has undergone an update, it is essential to initiate the <b><a href="migrate.xhtml">Migration Wizard</a></b> to ensure that the existing instance is fully operational. This process is crucial for maintaining the functionality and integrity of the system.</p>

The configuration files in container environments, such as the <code>ivy.yaml</code>, may be provided in a read-only mode.

  ComparisonReportInfo: To move an application from source to target security system the same users and roles must exist in the target security system as in the source system. By executing all CREATE operations, all missing users and roles will be created in the target security system. There is no need
    to execute the UPDATE operations or DELETE operations, but you may want to cleanup the target security system with these operations. It could be that the role already exists, but this one is not actually the same role. If this is the case, the role must be manually renamed in the target security system
    as well as the role in the Axon Ivy Project. Then the Axon Ivy Project must be redeployed.
