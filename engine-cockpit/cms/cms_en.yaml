  InPlaceMigrationIntroduction: This migration is an in place migration. Therefore, the new Axon Ivy Engine will be installed in exactly the same place as the old Axon Ivy Engine. The configuration files in container environments, such as the <code>ivy.yaml</code>, may be provided in a read-only mode.
    As the migration needs to operate with write access onto these configuration files, you can define whether a temporary directory should be used to perform these changes. After the migration, you must manually add these files to the Axon Ivy Engine.

  ComparisonReport: Comparison Report
  ComparisonReportInfo: To move an application from source to target security system the same users and roles must exist in the target security system as in the source system. By executing all CREATE operations, all missing users and roles will be created in the target security system. There is no need
    to execute the UPDATE operations or DELETE operations, but you may want to cleanup the target security system with these operations. It could be that the role already exists, but this one is not actually the same role. If this is the case, the role must be manually renamed in the target security system
    as well as the role in the Axon Ivy Project. Then the Axon Ivy Project must be redeployed.
